# To-Do-List
In this project, we have a python program which is used to create and maintain a 'To-Do' list of tasks for a user. 
The list is written into a database to access it even after the program is restarted. 

Technology and tools used:
1. Python 3.x
2. Sqlalchemy

Modules required:
1. sqlalchemy -> create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Date, sessionmaker
2. sqlalchemy.ext.declerative -> declarative_base
3. datetime -> datetime, timedelta
